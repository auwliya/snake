# Snake
This is a PyGame project of Snake. This Project was made by Auwliya / Lemon1 

## How To Play
To install this, you'll need to have the following installed:
- Python 3 (from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Pygame (installed with ```pip install pygame```)

Then, run snake_project.py to start the game. Just hit Play! Do make sure all the files/folders are in one folder.
The game part of the snake sometimes doesn't show up on screen, so make sure to drag the menu to the top of your screen before hitting play.
On the game-over screen it shows you your score, if you get a high one send it to me on discord!

There are different endings, so try to get to 400!

There are comments in the code explaining other uses and info.
