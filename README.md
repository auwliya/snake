# Snake

This is a PyGame project of Snake.
This Project was made by Auwliya Popal / Lemon1 (although I did follow a few youtube tutorials)

To run the game both the snake-project and the graphics folder need to be in the same folder.
The code uses Vector2 to simulate a grid, where the snake consists of blocks in the grid. It does not look like a block because I am using .blit to transport graphics onto the snake blocks

The game can be played with both the arrow keys and WASD controls.
When you crash into yourself or hit a border the game is over. As of right now the game closes itself once you're game over, but I might add a game-over screen or start menu.

Note: It's currently playable, but not finished
