# Snake

This is a PyGame project of Snake. You need pygame installed to play this.
This Project was made by Auwliya Popal / Lemon1 

To run the game everything needs to be in the same folder.
Press start.py to start the game, you will go to a menu screen.

There are comments in the code explaining other uses and info.
The game is playable, but I am still adding things (the menu screen doesn't work that well right now)
